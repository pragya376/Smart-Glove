### Smart-Glove

This interacting device is a microcontroller based system which will be used for communication between Disabled and Normal people.For example Deaf people make use of sign language or gestures to make grasp what he/she is trying to say but it is impossible to grasp by hearing people. So, that we come on closure of making a simple prototype by making use of some of those gestures and transforming it into speech and visual form so that they can be apprehend by everyone.

The System consists of following modules:- 
1. Data Glove using Flex Sensors 
2. Atmega16 microcontroller 
3. APR33A3 Voice Recorder & Playback.
4. LCD Display 
5. RF module
